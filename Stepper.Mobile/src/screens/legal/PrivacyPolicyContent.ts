Last updated: February 2026

At Stepper, we believe your data belongs to you. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. We've written this to be clear and understandable - no legal jargon.

## 1. Introduction

Stepper ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy applies to the Stepper mobile application and describes how we handle your personal information.

We never sell your data. Period.

## 2. Information We Collect

- Profile details: Age, height, weight (optional, for step calculations)

### Information Collected Automatically

- Step counts: Synced from your device's health services
- Activity data: Daily step totals, distances, streaks

### Information from Health Services

With your permission, we connect to:

- Apple Health (iOS)
- Google Fit (Android)

We only read step count data. We do not access other health information like heart rate, sleep, or medical records.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your data to:

- Provide the core service: Track your steps, calculate progress, maintain streaks

## 4. Analytics (Optional)

We use PostHog for analytics to understand how people use Stepper and improve the app.

### What analytics tracks (when enabled):

- App launches and session duration

- Milestone achievements (for improving the experience)

### What analytics does NOT track:

- Your actual step counts or health data
- Personal messages or group content

- Any data that directly identifies you

### Your choice:

- Analytics is opt-in - you choose whether to enable it
- You can change your preference anytime in Settings > Privacy
- The app works fully without analytics enabled

## 5. Data Sharing

We share your data only in these limited circumstances:

### With other users (based on your settings):

- Friends can see your display name, profile picture, and step counts
- Group members can see your group activity and rankings
- You control privacy settings for what others can see

### With service providers:

- Cloud hosting (to store your data securely)
- Analytics services (PostHog, only with your consent)

### When required:

- To comply with legal obligations
- To protect our rights or safety, or that of our users
- In connection with a merger or acquisition (with notice to you)

We require all service providers to protect your data and use it only for providing services to us.

## 6. Data Security

We take security seriously:

- All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Data is encrypted at rest in our databases
- We use secure authentication through Supabase Auth
- Regular security reviews and updates
- Access to user data is limited to essential personnel only

While we strive to protect your data, no system is 100% secure. We encourage you to use a strong password and keep your device secure.

## 7. Data Retention

- Active accounts: We retain your data while your account is active
- Deleted accounts: We delete your personal data within 30 days of account deletion
